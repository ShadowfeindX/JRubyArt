### Any editor
From console:-

```bash
mkdir 'any_name'
cd 'any_name'
touch 'fred.rb'
```

### Vim

Open new console
```bash
cd 'any_name'
vim fred.rb
```
In 1st console
```bash
k9 -w fred.rb
# A static bare sketch is displayed with default background
```
Edit sketch eg
```ruby
background 0
# Sketch reloads on `:w` save with a black background
```

### Other editors eg atom

From console
```
atom fred.rb
# opens sketch for editing in atom
```
From same console
```bash
k9 -w fred.rb
# A static bare sketch is displayed with default background
```
Edit sketch in atom, on save sketch will reload

### More Advanced Sketches
In console use sketch creator facility to create an outline sketch

```bash
k9 -c fred 200 200
# creates fred.rb, with `size 200, 200` you can do interesting
# things with code in the draw loop
```

Suggested exercises, set background and fill in draw loop, draw ellipse (or rect) in fixed location, then substitute `mouse_x` or `mouse_y` for `x` or `y` coordinates...
